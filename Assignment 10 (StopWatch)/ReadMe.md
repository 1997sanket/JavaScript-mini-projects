# My Approach 


  1. I need dynamic variables for minutes, seconds and milliseconds. But it doesnt automatically become dynamic
  we need a set() function to be called to set it everytime.
  
  2. So I am using setInterval() functions here to keep repeating the job every millisecond, every second and every minutes.
  I simply incremented the variables, but kept a limit on seconds and milliseconds i.e they cannot go beyond 60 and 100 
  respectively. I also changed the Start buttons design accordingly. And showed Reset button as required, as it was in my
  iPhone. Also, I used 'if' and 'else' to manipulate the start and stop button as it was technically the same button.
  I used a counter variable, when the counter's remainder was 0, start button will operate and when its' 1, stop button will
  operate.**
  
  3. Overall I'm extremely happy with this project, this was my last mini project, I am so happy, atleast now I know a
  little bit of JS. Its actually fun and not that difficult. Only with Asynchronous we have to be a little careful, its
  not the same as normal function. 
  Remember the event loop, the callback function, the defer in script tag, jQuery library,
  using Bootstrap, etc.  
  JS is fucking awesome.
